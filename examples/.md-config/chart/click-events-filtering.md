This sample shows how to implement interactive filtering, whereby clicks on one chart are used to generate filters which are applied to a second chart. To learn the basics of chart click events, see the [click events](https://github.com/mongodb-js/charts-embed-sdk/tree/master/examples/charts/click-events-basic) sample.

More information regarding how to handle click events can be found in the [Charts documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/charts/saas/handle-click-events/).

#### The features included in this demo are as follows:

- Adding a click event handler to a chart, using code similar to:

```javascript
chart.addEventListener("click", callback, options);
```

- Adding an option to make just certain parts of the chart clickable (in this case only the bars)
- Obtaining an MQL filter document based on the data returned in the payload using `selectionFilter`
- Highlighting the clicked element on the first chart using `setHighlight`
- Filtering a second chart using the `setFilter` method

11. In the same menu, note the **User Specified Filters** option. If you wish to try out filtering on your own dataset, you will need to whitelist a field by which to filter on. For example, our sample Movies dataset filters on `year` and `genres`.

      Furthermore, the filter related code in `src/index.js` will need to be updated to conform to the filter query you wish to apply.

    - Open the _index.js_ file (`src/index.js`)

    - Replace the filter in the `addEventListener` callback with a suitable filter document for your chart
