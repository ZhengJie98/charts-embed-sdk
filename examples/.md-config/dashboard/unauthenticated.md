ðŸŽ® _[Play with a live demo of this sample here](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/mongodb-js/charts-embed-sdk/tree/master/examples/dashboard/unauthenticated)_

#include "examples/docs/dashboard/background-desc.md"

This example, demonstrates how you might render an unauthenticated dashboard embedded onto your application via the SDK. If you don't want to use the SDK but want an easier way to render your dashboard, you can use an [embedded iframe](https://dochub.mongodb.org/core/charts-embedding-dashboards-iframe) instead.

#include "examples/docs/dashboard/features-unauthenticated.md"
- Manually refresh the dashboard (Refresh all charts within a dashboard)
- Set the whole dashboard theme to `'light'` or `'dark'`
- Set background colour of all charts shown on the dashboard. Note that this will overwrite the colour that has been set by the current theme
- Set the max data age of a chart on a dashboard
- Set the height and width mode to `'fixed'` or `'scale'`.
