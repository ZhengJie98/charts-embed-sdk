# MongoDB Charts Embedding Example - Unauthenticated Embedded Dashboard

## Background

ðŸ“„ _[See the MongoDB Charts Embedding Docs for more details](https://dochub.mongodb.org/core/charts-embedding-dashboards)_

ðŸŽ® _[Play with a live demo of this sample here](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/mongodb-js/charts-embed-sdk/tree/master/examples/dashboard/unauthenticated)_

The MongoDB Charts Embedding SDK allows you to embed a Chart or a Dashboard directly into your application. Just like embedded charts, you can embed a dashboard via unauthenticated or an authenticated method.

This example, demonstrates how you might render an unauthenticated dashboard embedded onto your application via the SDK. If you don't want to use the SDK but want an easier way to render your dashboard, you can use an [embedded iframe](https://dochub.mongodb.org/core/charts-embedding-dashboards-iframe) instead.

_Note that this is not an exhaustive list of all the features for the Dashboard Embedding SDK._

## Highlighted Features

In this example, you should be able to:

- Render an unauthenticated embedded dashboard
- Manually refresh the dashboard (Refresh all charts within a dashboard)
- Set the whole dashboard theme to `'light'` or `'dark'`
- Set background colour of all charts shown on the dashboard. Note that this will overwrite the colour that has been set by the current theme
- Set the max data age of a chart on a dashboard
- Set the height and width mode to `'fixed'` or `'scale'`.

## Quickstart

_The following steps presume the use of npm, though yarn works as well._

1. Ensure you have Node installed. You can confirm with `node --version`. On some operating systems, Node is available as the `nodejs` binary instead.

2. Clone the Git repository or download the code to your computer.

3. Run `npm install` to install the package dependencies.

4. Run `npm start`Â to start the application. This will utilise parcel.js.
   - Optional Parcel.js documentation https://parceljs.org/ for more information on what this is

This should create a local server running the Charts demo. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:1234` in the url bar to see the sample.

Happy Charting! ðŸš€ ðŸ“ˆ
