# MongoDB Charts Embedding Example - Unauthenticated Embedded Dashboard with `getChart` and `getAllCharts` methods

## Background

ðŸ“„ _[See the MongoDB Charts Embedding Docs for more details](https://dochub.mongodb.org/core/charts-embedding-dashboards)_

ðŸŽ® _[Play with a live demo of this sample here](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/mongodb-js/charts-embed-sdk/tree/master/examples/dashboard/unauthenticated-get-chart)_

The MongoDB Charts Embedding SDK allows you to embed a Chart or a Dashboard directly into your application. Just like embedded charts, you can embed a dashboard via unauthenticated or an authenticated method.

This example, demonstrates how you might render an unauthenticated dashboard embedded onto your application and retrieve all or just one chart on a dashboard.

_Note that this is not an exhaustive list of all the features for the Dashboard Embedding SDK._

## Highlighted Features

In this example, you should be able to:

- Render an unauthenticated embedded dashboard
- Manually refresh the dashboard (Refresh all charts within a dashboard)
- Get all the charts that are rendered on a dashboard via the SDK
- Manually refresh a chart instance that you have specified
- Adding/Removing click event listeners to a specific chart instance that you have specified
- Viewing the payload for a click event

## Quickstart

_The following steps presume the use of npm, though yarn works as well._

1. Ensure you have Node installed. You can confirm with `node --version`. On some operating systems, Node is available as the `nodejs` binary instead.

2. Clone the Git repository or download the code to your computer.

3. Run `npm install` to install the package dependencies.

4. Run `npm start`Â to start the application. This will utilise parcel.js.
   - Optional Parcel.js documentation https://parceljs.org/ for more information on what this is

This should create a local server running the Charts demo. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:1234` in the url bar to see the sample.

Happy Charting! ðŸš€ ðŸ“ˆ
