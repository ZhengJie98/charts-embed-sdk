# MongoDB Charts Embedding Example - Unauthenticated Embedded Chart

## Background

ðŸ“„ _[See the MongoDB Charts Embedding Docs for more details](https://docs.mongodb.com/charts/saas/embedding-charts/)_

ðŸŽ® _[Play with a live demo of this sample here](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/mongodb-js/charts-embed-sdk/tree/master/examples/charts/unauthenticated)_

MongoDB Charts allows you to create visualizations of your MongoDB data using a simple web interface. You can view the visualizations within the Charts UI, or you can use the Embedding feature to render the charts in an external web application.

Charts can be embedded either using a simple IFRAME snippet, or by using the Charts Embedding SDK from your JavaScript code. When using the SDK, embedded charts can be either unauthenticated (meaning anyone who has access to the page where the chart is embedded can view the chart), or authenticated (whereby the user can only view the chart if they have an active authentication session linked to a Charts authentication provider).

This sample shows how to use the JavaScript Embedding SDK to render unauthenticated embedded charts, along with showing off the various ways your application can interact with charts using the SDK.

#### The features included in this demo are as follows:

- Render an embedded chart on a web page
- Set the charts theme to either `'light'` or `'dark'`
- Get the charts current theme
- Set the charts max data age to various values
- Get the charts current max data age
- Manually refresh the chart
- Set the charts current filter
  - Note, filtering on a chart requires setting up white listed fields in MongoDB Charts. We have done this for our sample data.
- Get the current filter on a chart

## Quickstart

_The following steps presume the use of npm, though yarn works as well._

1. Ensure you have Node installed. You can confirm with `node --version`. On some operating systems, Node is available as the `nodejs` binary instead.
2. Clone the Git repository or download the code to your computer.
3. Run `npm install` to install the package dependencies.
4. Run `npm start`Â to start the application. This will utilise parcel.js

   - Optional Parcel.js documentation https://parceljs.org/ for more information on what this is

This should create a local server running the Charts demo. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:1234` in the url bar to see the sample.

## Preparing your Chart for Embedding

This sample is preconfigured to render a specific chart. You can run the sample as-is, or you can modify it to render your own chart by completing the following steps:

### Create chart to embed

1. Log onto MongoDB Charts
2. If you haven't done so already, create a chart on any dashboard that you would like to embed.

### Enable data source for unauthenticated access

3. Go to the Data Sources tab found on the side panel.
4. Find the data source that you want to use on the chart by selecting the deployment, database and collection. Once found, click on the Manage button in the Data access section to access the Data source management page.
5. Make sure the "External users can view data in this data source" option is toggled on and "Allow unauthenticated data access" has been selected.

### Enable chart for embedded access

6. Find the chart you want to embed, click the **...** menu and select **Embed chart**
7. Ensure the **Unauthenticated** tab is selected and turn on '**Enable unauthenticated access**'
8. Select the **Javascript SDK** option
9. Note the **Chart ID** and the **Base URL**, as you will need them for running the demo.
10. **Optional**
    In the same menu, note the **User Specified Filters** option. If you wish to try out filtering on your own dataset, you will need to whitelist a field by which to filter on. For example, our sample AirBnB dataset filters on `address.country`.

    Furthermore, the filter related code in `src/index.js` will need to be updated to conform to the filter query you wish to run, and the options provided in `index.html` will need to be updated too. To be clear,

    - Update the query **field** in `src/index.js`
    - Update the query **values** in `index.html`

## Running this Sample with your data

1. If you do not wish to use our sample data and have completed the above steps to prepare your own chart for embedding,
   - Open the _index.js_ file (`src/index.js`)
   - Replace the `baseUrl` string on with the base URL you copied from the MongoDB Charts Embedded Chart menu (look for "\~REPLACE\~" in the comments)
   - Replace the `chartId` string on with the chart ID you copied from the MongoDB Charts Embedded Chart menu (look for "\~REPLACE\~" in the comments)
   - Replace `address.country` in the `setFilter` code with your whitelisted field (look for "\~REPLACE\~" in the comments)
2. Run `npm install` to install the package dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to launch the sample application

This should create a local server running the Charts demo. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:1234` in the url bar to see the sample.

## Next Steps

Once you gain an understanding of the API, consider the following

- Take on the optional steps to prepare and manipulate your own data source rather than the sample.
- Think whether an unauthenticated chart is the feature you're after. [Embedding iframes](https://docs.mongodb.com/charts/master/embedded-chart-options/) from Charts is a great way to showcase your data if you don't need the user to interact with the chart.
- Consider the data you're making available, and the queries you're allowing. If the data is sensitive and you need to ensure the charts can only be accessed by authorized people, you should look at using authenticated embedding.

Happy Charting! ðŸš€ ðŸ“ˆ
